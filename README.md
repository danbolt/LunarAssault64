_Lunar Assault 64_ is an action game for the Nintendo 64. This was my submission for the [2020's N64Brew Game Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snZ6kIRLFUI).

## Playing the Game
This game is intended to run on a retail Nintendo 64. If you're interested in trying it, you'll likely need a flash cartridge. Common Nintendo 64 emulators might be a bit finnicky and aren't guarunteed to work with the ROM. Builds of the game are avaialable in the [`/releases`](/releases?raw=true) directory.

If you'd just like to see how the game looks, I've uploaded a playthrough of the game [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKp7P0ejpXU). N64Brew has also uploaded a video of the [PAL Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D9HI-nIohg) too.

If you have a PAL-M Nintendo 64 from Brazil, please reach out to me! I'd like to ensure the ROM works okay on your setup too.

## Compiling the Game
This game is built with the Nintendo 64 SDK, NuSystem Library, and the HVQM library. If you've been able to compile the various NuSystem samples, this should be pretty straightforward.

## Special Thanks
My Dad, Natasha Miner, and William Beltran did voice acting for this game. I wouldn't have been able to do it without them!
